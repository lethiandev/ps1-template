# Godot PS1 Game Template

Collection of assets and tools for Godot Engine v3.2 to help in creating retro games in <abbr title="PlayStation 1">PS1</abbr> style. Please also note that all the graphics were recreated but are not ripped-off from the original game console and may slightly differ in visuals found in the real console. If you want to contribute to the project - just make a pull request, it would be welcome.
